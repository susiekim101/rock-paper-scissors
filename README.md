# Rock Paper Scissors

As one of the final projects in the Foundations Course for the Odin Project, I practiced what I learned about HTML, CSS, and JSX to implement a responsive rock paper scissors game. The user plays against a computer that picks a random option at each run, and the player to reach 5 points first wins. The game includes a restart button to play again once the game ends.
